## Lesson 4. Building Polished User Interfaces

In this chapter you'll learn how to use several NativeScript features that let you build professional mobile user interfaces, such as listviews, layouts, and animations.

In the process you’ll complete the Groceries app, and have a functioning list-based app that you can share with your friends. Let’s get started by looking at some things you can do to customize NativeScript UI components.

### Step 1. Customizing UI components

So far, you’ve only used NativeScript UI elements by including them in an Angular component’s `template`, but you can also programatically create and access UI elements, and each UI component has a set of properties and methods you can use to customize your app.

#### Background: NativeScript modules

All NativeScript UI components are implemented as NativeScript modules, which are a series of TypeScript modules you use to add powerful functionality to your apps. There are a [lot of these modules](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/core-concepts/modules), and you will use several of them as you complete this tutorial.

The source code for the NativeScript modules lives on GitHub in the [NativeScript/NativeScript repo](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript). The modules are [distributed through npm as a “tns-core-modules” package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-core-modules), which all NativeScript apps depend on. Because the NativeScript modules are open source, you are welcome to [contribute changes](https://www.nativescript.org/contribute).

#### End Background

Before we start the next example, there’s one piece of background knowledge you need to know. In NativeScript, a single `<Page>` UI element wraps the `template` of every page-level Angular component. You don’t see this component, but it’s there, and it’s a UI component you can customize. Let’s look at how to do that by making a change to how the login page looks.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.ts` file, and add the following import to the top, which adds a reference to the `Page` class from the NativeScript core modules.

``` TypeScript
import { Page } from "tns-core-modules/ui/page";
```

* **b.** Next, alter the same file’s existing `"@angular/core"` import to include the `OnInit` interface.

``` TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
```

* **c.** `OnInit` is a [TypeScript class interface](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#class-types). To see how it works, make the following change to the declaration of your `LoginComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit {
```

After you add the new `implements` keyword, you should see an error in Playground that says something like *“Class ‘LoginComponent’ incorrectly implements interface ‘OnInit’”*. When you implement a TypeScript class interface, you’re telling the TypeScript compiler that you must implement all methods that the interface requires. In the case of `OnInit`, Angular requires you to implement a single `ngOnInit()` method.

* **d.** To implement it, add the following method to your `LoginComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
ngOnInit() {
  this.page.actionBarHidden = true;
}
```

> **NOTE**: `ngOnInit` is one of several [component lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html) that Angular provides. As its name implies, `ngOnInit` gets invoked when Angular initializes this component.

* **e.** We’ll discuss what the code within `ngOnInit()` does momentarily, but finally, to make these changes compile and run, change the `LoginComponent`’s existing `constructor()` declaration to use the code below.

``` TypeScript
constructor(private router: Router, private userService: UserService, private page: Page) {
```

> **NOTE**: Because the `Page` class is so commonly used in NativeScript apps, NativeScript provides this syntax as a shorthand for getting access to a component’s page. You’ll see other methods of getting access to UI components to change their properties later in this guide.

* **f.** Save your files. When your app refreshes the bar that previously appeared at the top of the screen on Android should now be hidden.

> **TODO:** Images of Android

<hr data-action="end" />

Now that you have this code in place, let’s discuss what happens on this line:

``` TypeScript
this.page.actionBarHidden = true;
```

This code uses an instance of the [`Page` class](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_page_.page.html) from the [NativeScript page module](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_page_.html), and sets its `actionBarHidden` property to `true`, which hides the ActionBar that shows by default on Android devices.

Although you can peruse the [NativeScript API documentation](http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/globals.html) for a full list of these properties and what they do, if you’re using a TypeScript-friendly IDE, you can get a full list of these properties at any point. You can see this behavior in NativeScript Playground.

> **TODO** Image of TypeScript autocomplete in Playground

Let’s make one last change to complete your login page, and this time we’ll use some new Angular syntax.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.html` file and change the opening `<StackLayout>` tag to use the following code.

``` XML
<StackLayout class="form" [class.dark]="!isLoggingIn">
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/login/login.component.css` file and add the following code to the bottom.

``` CSS
.dark {
  background-color: #301217;
}
.dark TextField {
  color:  #C4AFB4;
}
```

* **c.** Save your files. When your app updates on your device, click the **Sign up** button and note how the colors update automatically.

> **TODO** Add gif images for iOS and Android.

<hr data-action="end" />

The `[class.className]` syntax is a handy Angular feature that lets you conditionally apply class names based on a boolean condition. In this case, `[class.dark]="!isLoggingIn` tells Angular to apply the `dark` class name only when the component’s `isLoggingIn` flag is `false`.

What’s even cooler is that the syntax works even if you need to apply additional CSS class names to the component. That is, when using the syntax `class="form" [class.dark]="!isLoggingIn"`, Angular is smart enough to keep the `form` class name applied even as it toggles the `dark` class name. You might find this trick handy as you develop your NativeScript applications using Angular.

At this point in the tutorial your login screen is now complete. You’re welcome to continue tinkering with the page if you’d like, but next we’re going to move on to build the Groceries app’s list page. And you’ll start by learning about a new set of UI components.

### Step 2. Introducing NativeScript UI

In addition to the NativeScript [core user interface components](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/components), many of which you’ve used throughout this guide, NativeScript additionally provides a collection of free, professional components collectively known as [NativeScript UI](https://www.nativescript.org/ui-for-nativescript).

NativeScript UI contains controls for building drawers, listviews, calendars, charts, forms, autocompletes, and more. In fact, the graph you saw back in lesson one of this tutorial was a NativeScript UI component. To show what NativeScript UI can do, let’s look at to use the suite’s listview control to start to add a grocery list to your app.

#### Background: NativeScript plugins

NativeScript UI is a NativeScript plugin. [NativeScript plugins](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugins) are npm packages with some added native functionality, such as the ability to leverage Android and iOS SDKs.

Because NativeScript plugins require full iOS and Android builds to use, normally you cannot use NativeScript plugins in the NativeScript Playground environment.

However, a few NativeScript plugins have built-in support in NativeScript Playground, including NativeScript UI, [the accelerometer plugin](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-accelerometer), and the [geolocation plugin](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-geolocation). You can [learn more about using plugins on the NativeScript documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugins), and you can [peruse available plugins on the NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-geolocation).

#### End background

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your app’s `app/list/list.component.html` file and replace its contents with the following code:

``` XML
<ActionBar title="Groceries"></ActionBar>

<GridLayout>
  <RadListView [items]="groceryList">
    <ng-template let-item="item">
      <Label [text]="item.name" class="p-15"></Label>
    </ng-template>
  </RadListView>
</GridLayout>
```

> **NOTE**: The `<ActionBar>` is a common UI component that appears at the top of many mobile apps. You can [learn more about using the `<ActionBar>` component its documentation page](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/action-bar).

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.module.ts` file, and add the following import to the top of the file.

``` TypeScript
import { NativeScriptUIListViewModule } from "nativescript-pro-ui/listview/angular";
```

* **c.** After that, in the same `app/app.module.ts` file, add the `NativeScriptUIListViewModule` class you just imported to the `@NgModule`’s `imports` array. The array should now look like this.

``` TypeScript
imports: [
  NativeScriptModule,
  NativeScriptFormsModule,
  NativeScriptHttpModule,
  NativeScriptRouterModule,
  NativeScriptRouterModule.forRoot(routes),
  NativeScriptUIListViewModule
],
```

* **d.** Finally, open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the code below:

``` TypeScript
import { Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "gr-list",
  templateUrl: "list/list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["list/list.component.css"]
})
export class ListComponent implements OnInit {
  groceryList: Array<Object> = [];

  ngOnInit() {
    this.groceryList.push({ name: "Apples" });
    this.groceryList.push({ name: "Bananas" });
    this.groceryList.push({ name: "Oranges" });
  }
}
```

* **e.** Save your files. When your app refreshes on your device you should see a hardcoded grocery list.

> **TODO**: Add images for iOS and Android

<hr data-action="end" />

#### Background: Why you needed to import `NativeScriptUIListViewModule`

In Angular you must register directives, aka the tag names you use in your markup, before you use them in your templates. NativeScript does this automatically with the NativeScript core UI modules, but does not do this with the NativeScript pro modules, such as the listview you’re using in this example.

#### End Background

Let’s break down what’s happening in the example above. First, your `ListComponent` class now has a `groceryList` property that you fill with three objects in an `ngOnInit` handler. This makes an array of hardcoded data available for your template to bind to.

Let’s break down the template next.

``` XML
<RadListView [items]="groceryList">
  <ng-template let-item="item">
    <Label [text]="item.name" class="p-15"></Label>
  </ng-template>
</RadListView>
```

The [`<RadListView>` pro UI element](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/Controls/Angular/ListView/overview) requires an `items` property that points to an array of data—in this case, the `groceryList` array you added to your `ListComponent` class. The list view element requires a child `<ng-template>` element that specifies how to render each item in the `items` array.

The `let-*` syntax is Angular’s way of creating template variables within loops. You can think of the syntax working like TypeScript’s `let` keyword. This gives you the ability to refer to each item in the array as `item` within the template. For this template, you render each item in the array with a single `<Label>` UI element, and because of the `[text]="item.name"` binding, those labels contain the text from the `name` property of each of the items in `groceryList` TypeScript array.

#### Background: More about the `p-15` class name

The NativeScript Core Theme contains a number of class names that let you control the spacing of UI components within your application.

The class names follow a convention of margin/padding - top/bottom/left/right - amount. So for example, `<Label class="m-t-2">` renders a label with a `margin-top` of `2`, and `<Label class="p-b-5">` renders a label with a `padding-bottom` of `5`.

Therefore, in the example above `<Label class="p-15">` applies `padding: 15` to the label. You can [learn more about these class names on the NativeScript docs](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme#padding-and-margin).

#### End Background

Now that you have a hardcoded list of groceries displaying, let’s see how to swap that out with live data from a backend.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/shared/grocery/grocery.model.ts` and paste in the following code, which creates a simple `Grocery` model object that you can use throughout your app.

``` TypeScript
export class Grocery {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {}
}
```

* **b.** Next, let’s create a simple service that reads grocery lists from our backend.  Open your `app/shared/grocery/grocery.service.ts` file and paste in the following code.

``` TypeScript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Http, Headers, Response } from "@angular/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs/Rx";
import "rxjs/add/operator/map";

import { Config } from "../config";
import { Grocery } from "./grocery.model";

@Injectable()
export class GroceryService {
  constructor(private http: Http) {}

  load() {
    let headers = new Headers();
    headers.append("Authorization", "Bearer " + Config.token);

    return this.http.get(Config.apiUrl + "Groceries", {
      headers: headers
    })
    .map(res => res.json())
    .map(data => {
      let groceryList = [];
      data.Result.forEach((grocery) => {
        groceryList.push(new Grocery(grocery.Id, grocery.Name));
      });
      return groceryList;
    })
    .catch(this.handleErrors);
  }

  handleErrors(error: Response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(error.json()));
    return Observable.throw(error);
  }
}
```

The code here is very similar to the code you used in the `UserService` earlier in this guide. You use the `Http` service’s `get()` method to load JSON data, and RxJS’s `map()` function to format the data into an array of `Grocery` objects.

* **c.** To use this service, open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and add the following two lines to the top of the file:

``` TypeScript
import { Grocery } from "../shared/grocery/grocery.model";
import { GroceryService } from "../shared/grocery/grocery.service";
```

* **d.** Next, in the same `list.component.ts` file, change the existing `groceryList` declaration to use the newly imported `Grocery` class instead of a generic `Object`.

``` TypeScript
groceryList: Array<Grocery> = [];
```

* **e.** After that, add the following `constructor` function within the `ListComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
constructor(private groceryService: GroceryService) {}
```

* **f.** Because the previous line of code injects service into your constructor, you must also include it as a provider within your component decorator. To do so, replace the existing `@Component` decorator with the code below:

``` TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: "gr-list",
  templateUrl: "list/list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["list/list.component.css"],
  providers: [GroceryService]
})
```

* **g.** Finally, to kick off the call to your new service’s `load()` method, replace the `ListComponent`’s existing `ngOnInit()` method with the code below.

``` TypeScript
ngOnInit() {
  this.groceryService.load()
    .subscribe(loadedGroceries => {
      loadedGroceries.forEach((groceryObject) => {
        this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
      });
    });
}
```

In case you got lost during this section, your full `list.component.ts` file should now look like this.

``` TypeScript
import { Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild } from "@angular/core";

import { Grocery } from "../shared/grocery/grocery.model";
import { GroceryService } from "../shared/grocery/grocery.service";

@Component({
  selector: "gr-list",
  templateUrl: "list/list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["list/list.component.css"],
  providers: [GroceryService]
})
export class ListComponent implements OnInit {
  groceryList: Array<Grocery> = [];

  constructor(private groceryService: GroceryService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.groceryService.load()
      .subscribe(loadedGroceries => {
        loadedGroceries.forEach((groceryObject) => {
          this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
        });
      });
  }
}
```

* **g.** Save your files.

<hr data-action="end" />

When your app refreshes on your device you’ll see a blank list page, but you didn’t do anything wrong! Your app now reads grocery data from a backend, but you don’t have any groceries associated with your new account.

To really test out these changes you’ll need to allow users to add groceries to their lists, so let’s look at how to do that next.

### Step 3. Using advanced layouts

In order to allow users to add to their grocery lists, you need to add a few additional UI controls to the list page. While you could use a simple `<StackLayout>` to stack up the controls you need, let’s look at how to create a slightly more complex layout using the `<GridLayout>` element.

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.html` file and replace its contents with the following code:

``` XML
<ActionBar title="Groceries"></ActionBar>

<GridLayout rows="auto, *">

  <GridLayout row="0" columns="*, auto" class="add-bar">
    <TextField #groceryTextField hint="Enter a grocery item" col="0"></TextField>
    <Image src="~/images/add.png" col="1"></Image>
  </GridLayout>

  <RadListView row="1" [items]="groceryList">
    <ng-template let-item="item">
      <Label [text]="item.name" class="p-15"></Label>
    </ng-template>
  </RadListView>

</GridLayout>
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/list/list.component.css` file and replace its contents with the following code.

``` CSS
.add-bar {
  background-color: #CB1D00;
  padding: 5;
}
.add-bar Image {
  height: 15;
  vertical-align: center;
  margin-left: 10;
  margin-right: 10;
}
.add-bar TextField {
  padding: 10;
}
Label {
  background-color: white;
  border-bottom-width: 1;
  border-bottom-color: gray;
}
```

* **c.** Save your files. When your app refreshes with these changes on your device you should see the following UI.

> **TODO**: Add images for iOS and Android

<hr data-action="end" />

Let’s break down how this layout works, starting with the outer structure of the markup.

``` XML
<GridLayout rows="auto, *">
  <GridLayout row="0" class="add-bar">...</GridLayout>
  <ListView row="1">...</ListView>
</GridLayout>
```

The outer grid layout’s `rows` attribute divides the screen into two rows, the first auto-sized according to its childrens' height, and the other sized to take up *, or the remaining height of the screen. You place UI elements into these rows using the zero-based `row` attribute. The inner grid layout is in the top row because of its `row="0"` attribute, and the list view is in the bottom row because of its `row="1"` attribute.

Grid layouts can also divide the screen into columns, which is what the inner grid layout does.

```XML
<GridLayout columns="*, auto" class="add-bar">
  <TextField col="0"></TextField>
  <Image col="1"></Image>
</GridLayout>
```

Here the `columns` attribute divides the top of the screen into two columns. The `col="0"` attribute puts the text field in the first column, and the `col="1"` attribute puts the “+” image in the last column. Grid layouts are the most commonly used NativeScript layout, so you may wish to take a minute to play around with the `columns` and `rows` attributes to figure out how they work.

> **TIP**:
> * You can nest any of the [NativeScript layouts](/ui/layout-containers.html)—not just grid layouts.
> * You can pass numbers, percentages, and a variety of other values to create more complex grid layouts. Refer to the [grid layout docs](/ui/layout-containers.html#gridlayout) for more information.

Now that we have the UI ready, let’s make the add button work.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.html` and give the existing `<TextField>` a new `[(ngModel)]` attribute so that it looks like this:

``` XML
<TextField #groceryTextField [(ngModel)]="grocery" hint="Enter a grocery item" col="0"></TextField>
```

* **b.** Next, in the same file, add a new `tap` event binding to the image. The full `<Image>` should now look like this.

``` XML
<Image src="~/images/add.png" (tap)="add()" col="1"></Image>
```

With these attributes in place, your next steps are to define a new `grocery` property and `add()` method in your `ListComponent` class.

* **c.** To do that, open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and add the following two properties to the `ListComponent` class (right below the existing `groceryList` property):

``` TypeScript
grocery = "";
@ViewChild("groceryTextField") groceryTextField: ElementRef;
```

* **d.** Next, add the following import to the top of the same `list.component.ts` file.

``` TypeScript
import { TextField } from "tns-core-modules/ui/text-field";
```

* **e.** After that, add the following `add()` method to the existing `ListComponent` class:

``` TypeScript
add() {
  if (this.grocery.trim() === "") {
    alert("Enter a grocery item");
    return;
  }

  // Dismiss the keyboard
  let textField = <TextField>this.groceryTextField.nativeElement;
  textField.dismissSoftInput();

  this.groceryService.add(this.grocery)
    .subscribe(
      groceryObject => {
        this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
        this.grocery = "";
      },
      () => {
        alert({
          message: "An error occurred while adding an item to your list.",
          okButtonText: "OK"
        });
        this.grocery = "";
      }
    )
}
```

In this function you first ensure the user didn’t submit without typing a grocery. If the user did type something, you dismiss the device’s keyboard with the TextField element’s `dismissSoftInput()` method, and then call a new `add()` method on the `GroceryService`.

* **f.** To finish this example you have to define that new `add()` method. To do so, open your `app/shared/grocery/grocery.service.ts` file and paste the following function into the `GroceryService` class.

``` TypeScript
add(name: string) {
  let headers = new Headers();
  headers.append("Authorization", "Bearer " + Config.token);
  headers.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

  return this.http.post(
    Config.apiUrl + "Groceries",
    JSON.stringify({ Name: name }),
    { headers: headers }
  )
  .map(res => res.json())
  .map(data => {
    return new Grocery(data.Result.Id, name);
  })
  .catch(this.handleErrors);
}
```

* **g.** Save your files. When your app refreshes on your device you can now add grocery items and see them immediately appear in your list—and, all of this is completely driven by a backend service. Pretty cool, huh?

> **TODO**: Gifs for iOS and Android

<hr data-action="end" />

The `add()` code you used before should look familiar. You’re again using the `Http` service’s `post()` method to make an HTTP call to our backend, and then using RxJS’s `map()` function to convert the returned data into a `Grocery` object.

You consume that object in the `ListComponent`’s `add()` method, which adds the grocery to the page’s list by calling `this.groceryList.unshift()`, and then empties that page’s text field by setting `this.grocery` equal to `""`.

``` TypeScript
this.groceryListService.add(this.grocery)
  .subscribe(
    groceryObject => {
      this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
      this.grocery = "";
    },
    () => { ... }
  );
```

At this point you’ve come a long way. You have a functional login screen and now a backend-driven list that you can add to. Before you finish this tutorial you have a few more tasks though. Let’s start by allowing users to delete from the list, and then move on to add a loading indicator and some animations.

### Step 4. Customizing NativeScript UI components

NativeScript UI is a set of professional user interface components that includes a full charting library. As such, there are a tons of functionality you can use to enhance your applications.

In this step you’ll leverage one feature of the `<RadListView>` control, which you’ll use to allow users to delete groceries, and learn how to find out more about the NativeScript UI controls.

#### Background: Learning more about NativeScript UI

Because NativeScript UI has a lot of controls with a lot of features, it can be difficult to know where to start. Here are some recommendations.

* If you’re a video learner, start by watching [a tour of NativeScript UI on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JJVOxybR4E).
* If you like skimming documentation, the [NativeScript UI documentation](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/Controls/Angular/overview) has a thorough list of the controls and the features they offer.
* If you like getting your hands on code right away, the [NativeScript UI Angular sample](https://github.com/telerik/nativescript-ui-samples-angular/) is a sample app that shows off every feature of NativeScript UI in action.

#### End Background

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.html` file, and replace the entire `<RadListView>` component with the code you see below. Don’t worry about the details of what’s going on at the moment; we’ll break this down momentarily.

``` XML
<RadListView row="1" [items]="groceryList"
  swipeActions="true" (itemSwipeProgressStarted)="onSwipeCellStarted($event)">

  <ng-template let-item="item">
    <Label [text]="item.name" class="p-15"></Label>
  </ng-template>

  <GridLayout *tkListItemSwipeTemplate columns="*, auto">
    <StackLayout id="delete-view" col="1" (tap)="delete($event)" class="delete-view">
      <Image src="~/images/delete.png"></Image>
    </StackLayout>
  </GridLayout>

</RadListView>
```

* **b.** Next, in your `app/list/list.component.css` file, add the following CSS to the bottom of the file.

``` CSS
.delete-view {
  background-color: #CB1D00;
  padding: 20;
}
.delete-view Image {
  color: white;
}
```

* **c.** After that, open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and add the following new imports to the top.

``` TypeScript
import { ListViewEventData, RadListView } from "nativescript-pro-ui/listview";
import { View } from "tns-core-modules/ui/core/view";
```

* **d.** With those imports in place, in the same `app/list/list.component.ts` file, add the following two methods to the `ListComponent` class.

``` TypeScript
onSwipeCellStarted(args: ListViewEventData) {
  var swipeLimits = args.data.swipeLimits;
  var swipeView = args.object;
  var rightItem = swipeView.getViewById<View>("delete-view");
  swipeLimits.right = rightItem.getMeasuredWidth();
  swipeLimits.left = 0;
  swipeLimits.threshold = rightItem.getMeasuredWidth() / 2;
}

delete(args: ListViewEventData) {
  let grocery = <Grocery>args.object.bindingContext;
  this.groceryService.delete(grocery.id)
    .subscribe(() => {
      let index = this.groceryList.indexOf(grocery);
      this.groceryList.splice(index, 1);
    });
}
```

 * **d.** Finally, open your `app/shared/grocery/grocery.service.ts` and add the following method to the `GroceryService` class, which hits this tutorial’s backend endpoint to delete grocery items.

``` TypeScript
delete(id: string) {
  let headers = new Headers();
  headers.append("Authorization", "Bearer " + Config.token);
  headers.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

  return this.http.delete(
    Config.apiUrl + "Groceries/" + id,
    { headers: headers }
  )
  .map(res => res.json())
  .catch(this.handleErrors);
}
```

* **e.** Save your files. When your device updates with these changes, you should now be able to swipe on individual items on your list and tap a button to delete them.

<hr data-action="end" />

The NativeScript UI components have a ton of features that you can use to add powerful functionality to your applications. In the previous example you used the [`RadListView`’s swipe action capability](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/Controls/NativeScript/ListView/swipe-actions), which allows users to swipe on list items to perform actions.

#### Background: Details on using swipe actions

To understand how this works, let’s start back with the opening `<RadListView>` tag from your markup.

``` XML
<RadListView row="1" [items]="groceryList" [class.visible]="listLoaded"
  swipeActions="true" (itemSwipeProgressStarted)="onSwipeCellStarted($event)">
```

Setting the `swipeActions` attribute to `true` is necessary to turn on the `<RadListView>`’s swipe behavior. From there, the control triggers [a number of events](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/Controls/Angular/ListView/swipe-actions#swipe-actions) you can subscribe to configure exactly what you want to happen during swipes.

The only event you must subscribe to is the `itemSwipeProgressStarted` event, as you have to set a few values that control exactly how the swipe will work. With that in mind let’s look at your `onSwipeCellStarted` method and what it does.

``` TypeScript
onSwipeCellStarted(args: ListViewEventData) {
  var swipeLimits = args.data.swipeLimits;
  var swipeView = args.object;
  var rightItem = swipeView.getViewById<View>("delete-view");
  swipeLimits.right = rightItem.getMeasuredWidth();
  swipeLimits.left = 0;
  swipeLimits.threshold = rightItem.getMeasuredWidth() / 2;
}
```

The key here are the three lines of code at the bottom that set `right`, `left`, and `threshold` values. These values control the distance the user should be able to swipe right, swipe left, and the offset beyond which the swiped item will dock open, respectively.

In this example you’re saying the user should be able to swipe right for a distance that’s equal to the width of the delete button, that the user shouldn’t be able to swipe left, and that the user should be able to swipe half the width of the delete button before the button stays open.

> **NOTE**: Another popular way to configure swipe functionality is to perform an action automatically on swipe, without requiring the user to explicitly tap a button. The `<RadListView>` control supports this approach, and you read more about it on the [NativeScript UI documentation on the topic](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/Controls/Angular/ListView/swipe-actions#swipe-actions).

#### End Background

Now that users can both add and delete groceries from a list, let’s finish up this tutorial by adding a little polish to this list page.

### Step 5. Managing the UI during processing

Currently there's a bit of a delay when you first visit the list page before groceries appear. This delay could confuse a new user, who might think the app is stuck rather than retrieving data from a backend.

In NativeScript apps you can use the [ActivityIndicator](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_activity_indicator_.activityindicator.html) module to show a spinner icon in your UI while your app is busy performing actions. The `<ActivityIndicator>` is a relatively simple UI element as it primarily uses one attribute—`busy`. When an `<ActivityIndicator>`’s `busy` attribute is set to `true` the `<ActivityIndicator>` shows, and when its `busy` attribute is set to `false` it doesn't. Let's see how the module works by adding an `<ActivityIndicator>` to the list page.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.html` file and paste the following line immediately before the final `</GridLayout>`.

``` XML
<ActivityIndicator [busy]="isLoading" [visibility]="isLoading ? 'visible' : 'collapse'" row="1" horizontalAlignment="center" verticalAlignment="center"></ActivityIndicator>
```

This binds the `<ActivityIndicator>`’s `busy` attribute to an `isLoading` property in the `ListComponent` component.

* **b.** To define that property, open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and add the following line of code immediately under `grocery = ""`.

``` TypeScript
isLoading = false;
```

Now that the property exists, your final step is to set this flag to `true` when the grocery data is loading.

* **c.** To do that, in the same `list.component.ts` file, change the existing `ngOnInit()` function to use the code below.

``` TypeScript
ngOnInit() {
  this.isLoading = true;
  this.groceryService.load()
    .subscribe(loadedGroceries => {
      loadedGroceries.forEach((groceryObject) => {
        this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
      });
      this.isLoading = false;
    });
}
```

* **d.** Save your files. After your device refreshes with the changes, visit the list page. You should now see the following loading indicators.

> **TODO**: Add gifs for iOS and Android

<hr data-action="end" />

You can apply the same `row` or `column` attribute to multiple UI controls to have them take up the same space on the screen. The UI control that is defined last will appear on top, which is why the `<ActivityIndicator>` appears on top of the `<ListView>` in the previous example.

``` XML
<ListView row="1">...</ListView>
<ActivityIndicator row="1"></ActivityIndicator>
```

> **NOTE**: As a challenge, you can go back to the login page and try to add an `<ActivityIndicator>` that shows while the call to your user service is running. You can also try adding one on the list page when the user taps on the add button.

To finish off this tutorial you’re going to add one last feature to polish the display of your app—animations.

### Step 6. Creating engaging animations

The ability to run robust and performant animations is one of the biggest reasons people choose to build native mobile apps, and NativeScript makes running these animations simple. The NativeScript animation module provides a [series of JavaScript APIs](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation) that let you perform a wide variety of animations to elements on the screen, including the following:

- [Opacity](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-examples#opacity)
- [Background Color](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-examples#background-color)
- [Translations](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-examples#translate)
- [Scaling](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-examples#scale)
- [Rotating](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-examples#rotate)

Let’s add a simple animation that fades in the list page’s `<ListView>` so you can see how this works.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.css` file and add the following code at the bottom of the file.

``` CSS
ListView {
  opacity: 0;
}
.visible {
  animation-name: show;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
@keyframes show {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

This code sets the starting opacity value of the `<ListView>` to `0` so that the control is hidden when the page loads. The code also defines a `visible` class name that changes the `opacity` of an element from `0` to `1` over one full second.

> **TIP**: For background on how the CSS animations syntax works, feel free to refer to the [NativeScript CSS animation documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation-css), or [external CSS animation guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations).

* **b.** Now that you have the CSS in place, your next step is to add the previously defined `"visible"` class name to the `<ListView>` control after data has loaded. To do that, start by opening `app/list/list.component.ts` and adding the following new property right below the existing `isLoading = false;` line.

``` TypeScript
listLoaded = false;
```

* **c.** Next, in the same file, replace the existing `ngOnInit()` function with the following code, which sets the new `listLoaded` flag.

``` TypeScript
ngOnInit() {
  this.isLoading = true;
  this.groceryService.load()
    .subscribe(loadedGroceries => {
      loadedGroceries.forEach((groceryObject) => {
        this.groceryList.unshift(groceryObject);
      });
      this.isLoading = false;
      this.listLoaded = true;
    });
}
```

* **d.** Finally, open your `app/list/list.html` file and replace the opening `<RadListView>` tag with the following code, which adds a binding for the new `visible` class name.

``` XML
<RadListView row="1" [items]="groceryList" [class.visible]="listLoaded"
  swipeActions="true" (itemSwipeProgressStarted)="onSwipeCellStarted($event)">
```

* **e.** Save your files. When your app refreshes, you should now see a subtle fade-in animation when your list loads.

> **TODO**: Gifs for iOS and Android

<hr data-action="end" />

The key here is the list view’s `[class.visible]="listLoaded"` binding, which automatically applies the `visible` CSS class name based on the state of the `listLoaded` TypeScript property.

The advantage of using CSS animations is that you avoid the need to reference specific UI elements in your TypeScript code; there was no need to create a local template variable. The CSS animation approach also helps to keep your code decoupled. Your TypeScript code can focus on logic, and leave styling concerns to your CSS code.

> **TIP**: There’s a lot more you can do with NativeScript animations—look over the [NativeScript animation documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/animation) to get an idea of what you can do.

CSS animations are an easy way to add powerful animation to your code using syntax you might be familiar with from the web.
