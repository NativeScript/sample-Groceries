This branch contains the completed code for NativeScript’s [TypeScript and Angular 2 getting started guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0).

If you’re looking for the more complete implementation of Groceries with Angular, one that goes above and beyond what the guide covers, head over to the [“angular” branch](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/angular).
